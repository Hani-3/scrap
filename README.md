# WebScraping Project

Welcome to my Snapdeal Web Scraping project! In this project, I used Python Flask to create a web scraping application. The project not only extracts data from Snapdeal but also integrates MongoDB for efficient data storage. Additionally, I've built an API to facilitate seamless access to the collected information.


## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilized Python for effective web scraping of Snapdeal's website.
- **Flask App:** Developed a web application using Flask for a user-friendly interface.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Stored scraped data in MongoDB for organized and scalable data management.
- **API Development:** Created an API for easy retrieval of information.

To deploy this project follow below steps:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Hani-3/snapdeal_web_scraping.git
  cd review-scrapper-aws-main
```
2. Install requirements which is already listed in requirements.txt
```bash
 pip install -r requirments.txt
```
3. Run Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```
4. Explore the API and access the scraped data!
